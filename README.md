Set default status for Cash on Delivery (COD) orders. Also manage inventory reduction behavior for COD orders.

#Description

This plugin is made for people who need to confirm Cash-on-Delivery (COD) orders before processing them.

By default, WooCommerce sets COD order statuses to 'Processing' and reduces stock accordingly. If you need to reduce the stock only when an order is confirmed, this plugin is for you.

Set the default status of COD payment method to 'On-hold' or 'Pending Payment' and check 'Do not reduce stock'. And you are all set.

When the order is confirmed, and its status set to 'Processing' (usually by an admin or manager), stocks will be reduced.
